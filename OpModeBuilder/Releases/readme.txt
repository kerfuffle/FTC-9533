This is the section for releases of the OpModeMaker.

Supported systems are any that have the JRE runtime environment installed (target is JRE7, not necessarily needed, but recommended)

Windows and Mac native extensions will be provided (.exe, .app, etc.) as well has the standard .jar that can be run on almost any OS.


(Try running the OpModeMaker first, chances are you already have JRE installed)
