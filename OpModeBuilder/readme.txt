This is the section for our OpModeBuilder.

To aid other teams who are not yet used to programming, we provide a simple way of creating OpModes that needs little, if any, programming experience.


NOTE: While this program will provide a helpful way of making OpModes, it is more focused around TeleOps and not Autonomous, while some basic autonomous functions are available, it is in the programmers best interest to figure out how to do it within their IDE (Android Studio, Eclipse, etc.).
